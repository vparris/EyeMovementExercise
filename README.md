MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN: Mod. 8: Eye Movement Exercise

======================= Description =======================

In this exercise, we were asked to create a dynamic webpage featuring a pair of eyes that follow the movment of the mouse on the page.

======================= Roadmap =======================

Currently, I am working on trying to incorperate some simple CSS to create a dense jungle background for the eyes to be peering out from, and I would like to add additional pairs of eyes.
